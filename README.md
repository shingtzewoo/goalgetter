## About The Project
[Goalgetter](https://gentle-bayou-82963.herokuapp.com/) was a web application project built with a focus around two main ideas: core values and achieving annual goals/resolutions. Usually, annual goals/resolutions are very difficult to achieve
because people tend to focus on big picture unrealistic goals that have no clearly defined timeline and process. Additionally, some goals are just harder to achieve than others
because they do not resonate with what your core values are. By merging these two together, we can create goals that are more realistic and achievable and are based on 
what truly matters to you. This is called [value based goal setting](https://www.dummies.com/religion/spirituality/setting-and-achieving-value-based-smart-goals/).
